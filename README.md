### This repo contains code and data for 3-month Project in Aston Uni

How to Setup dashboard:

1) Clone the repo
2) ```sh
   cd '.\multi page'
   ```
3) ```py
    python streamlit run .\streamlit_app.py
   ```
4)
     `\multi page\apps' ` folder contains code for different pages of the dashboard and  `\multi page\data' ` contains all data files needed for the dashboard

5) `SUMO` outputs `.XML` file but the dashboard reads `CSV` files, in order to convert `XML` to `CSV` ued `xml_to_csv.ipynb`.
